        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Extension Name:</strong> Neukaps Gmail Resumes Extractor</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Neukaps Gmail Resumes Extractor ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information in connection with your use of our Chrome Extension (the "Extension").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The Extension is designed to perform a specific workflow initiated by you: extracting PDF resume attachments from selected emails in Gmail.</p>
        
        <h3>Personal Communications & Email Data</h3>
        <p>When you explicitly trigger the Extension on the Gmail website, access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email Metadata:</strong> Subject lines, sender names, and sender email addresses of the emails you have selected.</li>
            <li><strong>Attachments:</strong> The content of PDF attachments found within the emails you have selected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is accessed <strong>only</strong> when you click the Extension icon or trigger its functionality. We do not continuously monitor your emails or access emails you have not selected.</p>

        <h3>Website Content</h3>
        <p>The Extension reads the structural elements of the Gmail webpage (DOM) to identify selected rows, buttons, and attachment links necessary to perform the extraction.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for the sole purpose of providing the service you requested:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To identify and download resume (PDF) files from your selected emails.</li>
            <li>To display a summary of extraction results to you.</li>
            <li>To securely transfer the extracted resume data and associated candidate metadata (sender name/email) to your account on the Neukaps platform (https://neukaps.com) for your recruitment workflow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We <strong>do not</strong> use your data for advertising, marketing, creditworthiness assessment, or any purpose unrelated to the Extension's core functionality.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside third parties.</p>
        <p>Your data is shared only with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neukaps Platform:</strong> The data is sent to the Neukaps application (owned and operated by us) to allow you to view and manage your candidates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong> All communication between the Extension, Gmail, and the Neukaps platform occurs over secure, encrypted HTTPS connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Temporary data stored in your browser (via `chrome.storage.local`) is confined to your local machine and deleted or overwritten as needed for the application's state management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Consent</h2>
        <p>By using our Extension, you consent to this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page.</p>

        <h2>7. Contacting Us</h2>
        <p>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us regarding the Neukaps service.</p>
